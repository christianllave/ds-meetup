Categorical variables are either nominal (unordered ex. colours: red, blue, yellow) or ordinal (good, better, best). Some cases like days of the week can be represented as either a category or a number, depending on the application (i.e. if you're using the variable as a category or you're using difference in time as the variable).\n",
